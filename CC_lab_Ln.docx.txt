or Google Compute Engine in Google Cloud: Create first GCP VM Instance




Experiment No.6
you tube link-Deploy Simple web application on GCP VM
Create an Apache web server on a Linux VM
  

Learn how to:
1. Create a Linux VM in Compute Engine.
2. Log in to the VM.
3. Install Apache web server on the VM.
4. Create and view a simple website.
Steps  A
1. Create a new project to ensure that you have the permissions that you need or select an existing project in which you have the relevant permissions.


2. Click Enable APIs to enable the required APIs for the tutorial.
The necessary APIs are enabled:
   * Compute Engine API
Steps  B
Create the server VM
1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the VM instances page.
2. When the VM instances page is ready, click Create instance.
3. In the Name field, enter a name for your VM.
If you don't have a specific name to use, then enter example-vm.
4. In the Region list, select your region or zone. Regions are collections of zones. Zones have high-bandwidth, low-latency network connections to other zones in the same region.
If you don't have a specific region to use, then select us-central1 for demonstration purposes.
5. In the Zone list, select the appropriate zone.
A zone is a deployment area within a region. Depending on how widely you want to distribute your resources, create VMs across multiple zones in multiple regions for redundancy.
If you don't have a specific zone to use, then select us-central1-a for demonstration purposes.
6. In the navigation menu, click OS and storage.
7. Click Change.
8. In the Boot disk pane, on the Public images tab (default), select the following options:
   1. In the Operating system list, select Debian.
   2. In the Version list, keep the default value.
   3. In the Boot disk type list, select SSD persistent disk.
   4. Click Select.
9. In the navigation menu, click Data protection.
10. In the Back up your data section, select No backups.
11. In the navigation menu, click Networking.
12. In the Firewall section, select Allow HTTP traffic.
13. Click Create.
Your new VM will be listed on the VM instances page. When a checkmark appears, you can connect to the VM and install software.


Steps  C
Install an Apache server
1. To open a terminal to your VM, in the Connect column, click SSH.
A new cmd window opens showing you are connected to your VM terminal. 
For help with connection issues, see Troubleshooting SSH errors.
2. Update the package lists on your VM:
Type command 
sudo -i and   then     sudo apt-get update
When this process is finished, you get this message:
Reading package lists... Done
3. Install the Apache2 HTTP Server:
sudo apt-get install apache2 php7.0
4. Overwrite the Apache web server default web page with the following command:
echo '<!doctype html><html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>' | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
 steps D
Test your server
1. In the Google Cloud console, go to VM instances.
2. In the External IP column, copy the VM's IP address.
3. Paste the IP address in a new browser tab.
you will see your Hello World! page,
